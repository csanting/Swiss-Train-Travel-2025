Quick overview of Swiss train travel options (based on my experiences only).

## Travel Within Switzerland

When traveling solely within Switzerland, all tickets and passes for the main routes are best purchased directly from [SBB (Schweizerischen Bundesbahnen)](https://www.sbb.ch/en). If taking specific transportation for mountain excursions, you will need to search the specific mountain for tickets/schedules/seasons. It is also recommended to get the [SBB App](https://www.sbb.ch/en/travel-information/apps/sbb-mobile.html) as it makes buying and managing tickets/passes simple.

There are a few different ticket and pass types that could be optimal depending on how many trains you are taking within a day or consecutive days:

- [Swiss Pass](https://www.sbb.ch/en/tickets-offers/tickets/guests-abroad/swiss-travel-pass.html)
  - The Swiss Pass is geared towards tourists. It comes in 3, 4, 6, 8, and 15 day versions.
  - Note that for the standard Swiss Pass, once the pass is validated, it is only valid for the next # of consecutive days. So if you will be traveling a lot in a few days, this is useful.
  - If you need more flexibility, there is the Swiss Pass Flex version for a bit more money. It has the same options for day counts as the regular pass except you can pick and choose which days you are going to travel and validate it each day. You are not restricted to consecutive days. Keep in mind that the pass is only valid for 1 month so all days should be used within that time frame.
  - The Swiss Pass includes additional discounts for mountain excursions, free musem entry, etc....
  - Route validity can be found [here](https://www.travelswitzerland.com/en/downloads/?wpdmdl=63507) which is found on the [Swiss Pass website](https://swisstravelpass.com/).

- [Swiss Half-Fare Card (Halbtax)](https://www.sbb.ch/en/tickets-offers/tickets/guests-abroad/swiss-half-fare-card.html)
  - This pass gives discounts on most tickets and passes. Not necessarily half off all the time as the name suggests but it is great value.
  - For tourists, there is a 120 CHF Halbtax that is valid for 1 month. You can compare the price of your planned tickets at full price and with the Halbtax to see if it makes sense. Based on experience, even 3 or 4 trips and the pass pays for itself in savings.
  - Important to note is that the Swiss Pass above and Half-Fare card are not compatible. If you are getting the Swiss Pass, you do not need a Halbtax unless you plan to travel a lot outside of the Swiss Pass days.

- [Saver Day Pass](https://www.sbb.ch/en/tickets-offers/tickets/day-passes/saver-day-pass.html)
  - Saver Day Passes are popular for both locals and tourists as they offer very cheap, unlimited travel but must be bought in advance as there are a limited number of passes available. As they deplete, the price goes up.
  - They are for a specific day only.
  - Buying even just a couple weeks in advance should get you the lowest price.
  - The Saver Day Pass is best if you will travel a lot in a single day and for just a couple of days across your entire trip.
  - It has the same route validity as the Swiss Pass.
  - If you have a halbtax, there are additional savings.

- Point-to-Point Ticket
  - This type of ticket is availabe to purchase after you have searched on the SBB site for a given route.
  - The ticket is valid on a specific day for a specific route until 5AM the following day. IE 12:01 AM on Sunday until 5:00 AM on Monday.
  - You are able to take that route at any time within the validity period.
  - Important note: The Point-to-Point Ticket is valid for specific routes only, not destination/origin combinations. Another example, If the ticket is from Zurich HB to Bern with no transfers, you cannot take a train with different route that has a transfer.
  - The ticket will mention the route that it is valid for. When purchasing the ticket on SBB's website, pay attention to the "Direction" label. If they match, the ticket is valid on all of them.

- Super Saver Ticket
  - Like the Point-to-Point Ticket, this type of ticket is availabe to purchase after you have searched on the SBB site for a given route.
  - Unlike the Point-to-Point ticket, it is only valid for a specific train at a specific time.
  - It is cheaper but restricts spontaneity. If you know for sure which time you would like to leave/arrive, then this is ideal.
  - Like the Saver Day Pass, it must be purchased at least the day before travel.

When traveling within a city, you need to check the local transportation company for passes, tickets, zone validity, etc. For example, in Geneva, you can find ticket and pass prices for buses/trams on [TPG (Geneva Public Transport)'s site](https://www.tpg.ch/en/ticket-fares). You can do the math against how much you will travel in a day within the city to see if a pass is worth it. In Zurich, you check [ZVV](https://www.zvv.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/tickets.html). Most local travel tickets cannot be purchased on the SBB app.

In all cases of travel within Switzerland, unless taking special trains such as the [Bernina Express](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ca/experiences/bernina-express/) or the [Glacier Express](https://glacierexpress.ch/en), seat reservations are not necessary.
