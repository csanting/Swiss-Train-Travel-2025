# Swiss-Train-Travel-2025
Quick overview of Swiss (and selected other EU country) train travel options (based on my experiences only).

## Travel Within Switzerland

When traveling solely within Switzerland, all tickets and passes for the main routes are best purchased directly from [SBB (Schweizerischen Bundesbahnen)](https://www.sbb.ch/en). If taking specific transportation for mountain excursions, you will need to search the specific mountain for tickets/schedules/seasons. It is also recommended to get the [SBB App](https://www.sbb.ch/en/travel-information/apps/sbb-mobile.html) as it makes buying and managing tickets/passes simple.

There are a few different ticket and pass types that could be optimal depending on how many trains you are taking within a day or consecutive days:

- [Swiss Pass](https://www.sbb.ch/en/tickets-offers/tickets/guests-abroad/swiss-travel-pass.html)
  - The Swiss Pass is geared towards tourists. It comes in 3, 4, 6, 8, and 15 day versions.
  - Note that for the standard Swiss Pass, once the pass is validated, it is only valid for the next # of consecutive days. So if you will be traveling a lot in a few days, this is useful.
  - If you need more flexibility, there is the Swiss Pass Flex version for a bit more money. It has the same options for day counts as the regular pass except you can pick and choose which days you are going to travel and validate it each day. You are not restricted to consecutive days. Keep in mind that the pass is only valid for 1 month so all days should be used within that time frame.
  - The Swiss Pass includes additional discounts for mountain excursions, free musem entry, etc....
  - Route validity can be found [here](https://www.travelswitzerland.com/en/downloads/?wpdmdl=63507) which is found on the [Swiss Pass website](https://swisstravelpass.com/).

- [Swiss Half-Fare Card (Halbtax)](https://www.sbb.ch/en/tickets-offers/tickets/guests-abroad/swiss-half-fare-card.html)
  - This pass gives discounts on most tickets and passes. Not necessarily half off all the time as the name suggests but it is great value.
  - For tourists, there is a 120 CHF Halbtax that is valid for 1 month. You can compare the price of your planned tickets at full price and with the Halbtax to see if it makes sense. Based on experience, even 3 or 4 trips and the pass pays for itself in savings.
  - Important to note is that the Swiss Pass above and Half-Fare card are not compatible. If you are getting the Swiss Pass, you do not need a Halbtax unless you plan to travel a lot outside of the Swiss Pass days.

- [Saver Day Pass](https://www.sbb.ch/en/tickets-offers/tickets/day-passes/saver-day-pass.html)
  - Saver Day Passes are popular for both locals and tourists as they offer very cheap, unlimited travel but must be bought in advance as there are a limited number of passes available. As they deplete, the price goes up.
  - They are for a specific day only.
  - Buying even just a couple weeks in advance should get you the lowest price.
  - The Saver Day Pass is best if you will travel a lot in a single day and for just a couple of days across your entire trip.
  - It has the same route validity as the Swiss Pass.
  - If you have a halbtax, there are additional savings.

- Point-to-Point Ticket
  - This type of ticket is availabe to purchase after you have searched on the SBB site for a given route.
  - The ticket is valid on a specific day for a specific route until 5AM the following day. IE 12:01 AM on Sunday until 5:00 AM on Monday.
  - You are able to take that route at any time within the validity period.
  - Important note: The Point-to-Point Ticket is valid for specific routes only, not destination/origin combinations. Another example, If the ticket is from Zurich HB to Bern with no transfers, you cannot take a train with different route that has a transfer.
  - The ticket will mention the route that it is valid for. When purchasing the ticket on SBB's website, pay attention to the "Direction" label. If they match, the ticket is valid on all of them.

- Super Saver Ticket
  - Like the Point-to-Point Ticket, this type of ticket is availabe to purchase after you have searched on the SBB site for a given route.
  - Unlike the Point-to-Point ticket, it is only valid for a specific train at a specific time.
  - It is cheaper but restricts spontaneity. If you know for sure which time you would like to leave/arrive, then this is ideal.
  - Like the Saver Day Pass, it must be purchased at least the day before travel.


### Additional Notes
- For all of the above, there are 1st and 2nd class options. 2nd class can get busy depending on the route and time, to the point you may need to stand, but is still extremely comfortable.
- When traveling within a city, you need to check the local transportation company for passes, tickets, zone validity, etc. For example, in Geneva, you can find ticket and pass prices for buses/trams on [TPG (Geneva Public Transport)'s site](https://www.tpg.ch/en/ticket-fares). You can do the math against how much you will travel in a day within the city to see if a pass is worth it. In Zurich, you check [ZVV](https://www.zvv.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/tickets.html). Most local travel tickets cannot be purchased on the SBB app.
- In all cases of travel within Switzerland, unless taking special trains such as the [Bernina Express](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ca/experiences/bernina-express/) or the [Glacier Express](https://glacierexpress.ch/en), seat reservations are not necessary.
- SBB trains are extremely punctual. You cannot be even a minute late. They will shut the door in your face and tell you too bad.

## Travel To/From Switzerland and Other Countries

When traveling to or from Switzerland and another country, it is best to use the other country's transportation provider to purchase tickets. You can buy them from SBB, but they are almost always more expensive and full price.

### France

Tickets should be bought from [SNCF](https://www.sncf-connect.com/en-en/), the state-owned rail company. High-speed and long-distance rail is usually provided by TGV. For long-distance, it is best to reserve a specific seat so you can sit near fellow travellers and, most importantly, actually have a seat.

Important to do before travelling to/within France is to check for a strike (you can just google). They are usually announced well in advance so that alternative arrangements can be made. The stereotype is a stereotype for a reason.

### Germany

Inter-city tickets should be purchased from [DB (Deutsche Bahn)](https://int.bahn.de/en). I will not get into specific ticket and pass types but a seat reservation is recommended. For regional travel, you will need to search for regional train providers. But usually you can purchase everything you need on DB's site.

Two important notes about DB:
1. The ticket prices can get outrageously high and even sold out if you try to purchase close to the departure time/date. Buy in advance if you can.
2. Unlike SBB, DB's schedule is just a suggestion. Always anticipate you will be late.

### Italy

Italy has more providers than other countries. There are two main inter-city providers and a number of regional providers.

[Trenitalia](https://www.trenitalia.com/en.html) is the state-owned provider and most tickets can be purchased here. [Italo](https://www.italotreno.com/en) is privately owned. It provides service mostly in South Italy. There is overlap on the routes covered between the companies. Like DB, the price of tickets will increase dramatically close to departure so try to plan in advance.

### Overnight

[Austria's OBB Nightjet](https://www.nightjet.com/en/) has long-distance, overnight trains to and from major cities across Europe. Only use Nightjet if you really need to save money or are time restricted. The rocking back and forth, loud noises, late/early schedule, etc... contribute to an awful sleep. You also need to buy far in advance unless you want to be sitting in a chair overnight.

### More Than Two Countries

If you will be travelling across multiple countries, consider the [Eurail Pass](https://www.eurail.com/en). It is meant to facilitate tickets across the different providers as an all-in-one pass. Details are beyond the scope of this write-up, but there are many procedures and considerations when using Eurail. A bit of research (and maybe even a diagram) is needed, but once it is all digested, it can save a lot of money while offering convenience.
